Wrote microservices using Java SpringBoot and exposed application logic via REST API. Maven was used for package management. Postman was used to preliminary test the API routes and SQLDeveloper was used to check that the database systems were updated correctly in DEV environment. Took the initiative to learn to use an internal Citi DevOps tool in order to set up the CI/CD pipeline and customize it to the needs of the project. This involved learning to set up deployment tool Udeploy, and linking this to an existing OpenShift server to successfully host the microservices on pods. Git & Bitbucket were used for version control, and JIRA was used to coordinate with the wider team."
